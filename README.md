## Background

**[HTTP Signatures IETF draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures)**

This is a library specifically for creating and verifying the `Digest:` header,
for use with HTTP Signatures and similar mechanisms.

This is a standalone separate library from 
[`http-signature-header`](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/http-signature-header)
so as not to introduce dependencies on cryptographic libraries to that lib.

It's intended to be isomorphic (for use both in the browser and server-side, with
Node.js).

## Install

To install from `npm`:

```
npm install http-signature-digest
```

To install locally (for development):

```
git clone https://github.com/digitalbazaar/http-signature-digest.git
cd http-signature-digest
npm install
```

## Usage

```js
const httpDigest = require('http-signature-digest');

const data = `{"hello": "world"}`;

const result = await httpDigest.
    createDigestString({data, algorithm: 'sha256', useMultihash: false});

// -> SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=
